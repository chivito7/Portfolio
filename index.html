                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>After graduating high school, I always regretted not coding. However, after taking a couple of programming classes in community college, I knew it was not too late for me. I quickly learned and I was eager to create new projects.
                    Now, I am pursuing my dream of working as a programmer by enrolling in Thinkful's Software Engineering bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>I loved working with my classmates. Not only was I able to share new and effective ways to improve our coding projects, but I also learned many new things. I also had a glimpse of what my future can look like working on impactful projects
                    alongside like-minded people who love programming.</p>
                    <p>I also really love listening to music and playing my guitar. In particular, I always sing along to the band Fleetwood Mac and to Lana Del Rey. I have actually learned how to play many songs on the guitar from both artists!</p>
